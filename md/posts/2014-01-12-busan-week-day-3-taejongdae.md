The first half of our third day (see the first 2 [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-1-haeundae-beach-20.html) and [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-2-yeonggung-sa-21.html)) in Busan was the lowest point of the whole week. We had a reservation for the "[Eulsukdo eco](http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/)" tour in the morning, but my daughter vomited just when we were about to reach Busan station. We had no choice but to head back to the hotel.

Once we were ready again, We took the looped city tour bus and visited [Taejongdae](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D264167). It is a hill which hosts the Taejongdae resort. This time, we took the Haeundae loop tour bus to go from Haeundae beach to busan and it passed via the famous [Gwangan bridge](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D1064834):

Unfortunately, we made the bad decision of getting down at the "Busan art museum" stop. The decision was bad because after getting down, we went in the wrong direction and spent about 15 minutes just searching for the place. We were already pissed off because of the bad start, so we came back to the bus stop and waited another 20 mins for the bus. But this time we were laughing at our stupidity, because the art museum was just 1 min away from the stop. Anyways, we weren't in a mood to go there after this. Fortunately, the same bus got converted into the Taejongdae loop tour bus. So we did not have to get down of the bus, but also were able to catch a good window seat ;) On the way to Taejongdae from Busan, we passed the 75-square stop (which we did not get down at). The sea-meets-the-sky view was simply amazing. Here are some ok-ok shots from inside the moving bus

On reaching Taejongdae we boarded the mini tram and saw the place; we did not get down from the tram at any of the stops that it made, including the light-house:

From Taejongdae we took the loop tour bus back to Busan; but this time we got a bus with an open top. This was the first time for both my wife and me to sit in an open roof double-decker bus, and it was an amazing experience. On the way we passed [Songdo](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D1054924) [beach](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d3420565-Reviews-Songdo_Beach-Busan.html) and the world famous [Jagalchi](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d1372972-Reviews-Jagalchi_Market-Busan.html) [fish](http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid%3D264168) [market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagalchi_Market), but did not get down at either
