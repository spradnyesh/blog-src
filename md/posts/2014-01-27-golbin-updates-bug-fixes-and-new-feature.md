Hi! We hope that you are liking the various stories that you see here on [Golbin](http://www.golb.in/). We are always striving not only to bring you quality content that will interest you, but are also adding new features to the site. As we have mentioned previously [here](http://www.golb.in/lazyload-google-ads-without-jquery-lazyload-ad-plugin-27.html), [here](http://www.golb.in/more-exciting-new-features-for-golbin-25.html), [here](http://www.golb.in/speed-your-website-100-times-11.html) and [here](http://www.golb.in/exciting-new-features-on-golbin-9.html), we have regularly added new features, and we sincerely hope that you like them :)</p>

In today's release we have made the following changes:</p>

* <b>CSS fix</b>: We have fixed some css issues (especially related to 'table', and 'li' elements) that made some of the articles look bad</li>
* <b>image size</b>: In the recent articles ([here](http://www.golb.in/org-mode-32.html), [here](http://www.golb.in/vimperator-part-2-31.html), etc), the images inside the article were of very small size (width = 300px) due to which they were not able to deliver the content that they were supposed to. This irritating issue has been fixed</li>
* <b>future publish</b>: We have added a new feature to the editorial site so that an author can enter any date-time in the future and publish the article. The article will get saved in the "draft" mode and will automatically be published on the said date-time. This will allow the authors to write stories in advance for an event and be rid of the worry of needing to publish it on the desired date-time. Ain't it cool?</li>
* <b>auto archival</b>: This is another great feature that we have added to the editorial site. Actually, to be honest, it always existed, but was not visible to authors due to a bug that has now been fixed. The feature is that every time an author publishes his article, it gets saved on the [web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org) website. For example the last [article](http://www.golb.in/ml-302-intuition-for-univariate-linear-regression-39.html) got archived [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140124145929/http://www.golb.in/ml-302-intuition-for-univariate-linear-regression-39.html). This is an important feature because it will allow resolution of issues in case there is a plagiarism issue recorded (by or against [Golbin](http://www.golb.in/))</li>

If all this sounds great to you, do share it with others, and surely leave your comments/feedback. Better still, why don't you join us share your stories; after all that is why this website exists, doesn't it?</p>
