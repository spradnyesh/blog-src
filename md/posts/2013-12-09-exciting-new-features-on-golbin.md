We have been absent from writing articles for some time now because we were working on improving the [Golbin!](http://www.golb.in/) experience. For both viewers and story-tellers! So lets see what's new in [Golbin!](http://www.golb.in/):

* **Load comments via [ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming\))**: This feature will load comments in a lazy fashion; that is, after the whole page has been loaded. Because of this, the page-load-time (as seen by search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc) will improve and give [Golbin!](http://www.golb.in/) a better [SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) ranking.
* **Threaded comments**: Viewers can now reply to existing comments, or add fresh new comments of their own. We hope that this will increase viewer engagement. Not only via interaction within themselves, but even the story-teller will be able to respond to particular comments and have a meaningful, relevant and easy-to-follow conversation!
* **Page backgrounds**: Story-tellers can now define a custom image for all of their pages (story pages, and author page) and make their stories more beautiful and attractive for viewers. Also, this will help them distinguish themselves from other story-tellers, and portray their personality more effectively!
* **Improved editorial site performance**: Last, but not least, we made some performance improvements to the editorial site. This small change alone brought the page timings down from 3 seconds to 30 milliseconds, an improvement of **100x!**

That's not all. We will be adding new features, both small and big, regularly. Sometimes they will be user facing (affecting either viewers and/or story-tellers) and sometimes not. But either ways, we will keep you folks updated. See you soon, with the next set of updates!

ps: We would be delighted to hear from you about what features you would like to be added to our site! Also, don't feel shy to go ahead, register, and share your stories with the world! Click [here](http://ed.golb.in/register/why/) to see the benefits of writing on [Golbin!](http://www.golb.in/)
