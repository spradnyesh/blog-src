Since today was the last day of tour, we decided to go for the "[Eulsukdo eco-center](http://busan.for91days.com/2012/07/06/the-eulsukdo-island-bird-sanctuary/)" themed tour that we had missed on the unfortunate 3rd day. So we got up early and went to Busan station. But it looks like the Eulsukdo tour was jinxed. When I called the Busan city tour help-desk (+82-51-464-9898), they told me that both the morning and afternoon tours were fully reserved. Anyways, we were already in the bus and went to Busan station hoping that someone might skip (like we had on our 3rd day). We reached the station just a few minutes before the departure only to find out that there was just 1 empty seat. Dejected, we tried to decide what to do next. We had 3 options:

* Visit Beomeosa ([[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beomeosa)], [[2](http://koreantemples.com/?p%3D241)], [[3](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d615908-Reviews-Beomeosa_Temple-Busan.html)]) temple by ourselves</li>
* Visit [Gamcheon](http://www.busanhaps.com/article/history-hills-busans-gamcheon-culture-village) [culture](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297884-d3901349-Reviews-Gamcheon_Culture_Village-Busan.html) village by ourselves</li>
* Go back to hotel and come back for afternoon tour</li>

We decided to do the third because we did not want to wander out on our own with a baby in our hands. We visited the Haeundae beach on our way back to the hotel, where we saw a lot of [black-legged seagulls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-legged_Kittiwake) up close

In the afternoon, we left early only to reach 40 mins before time for the Eulsukdo tour. This time our wait was fruitful because we were the 1st people to board the bus and got a good seat too. Unfortunately, there weren't any birds (other than ducks, which was not exciting at all) at the eco-center :(

This marked the end of our tour, and the next day we traveled back from Busan to Suwon on the KTX. Although the train reached top speeds of 290+ kmph, it always did so when inside tunnels, so we weren't able to see outside. But we did notice our ears getting jammed, and could feel the speeds. Also, this time again, I tried to do the photography technique that I had mentioned in the day-1 post [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-1-haeundae-beach-20.html). This time I had more success, but none of the photos turned out to be good enough. Even then, it was a good learning experience.

I hope you all loved the travelogue (older posts are [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-1-haeundae-beach-20.html), [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-2-yeonggung-sa-21.html), [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-3-taejongdae-22.html) and [here](http://www.golb.in/busan-week-day-4-busan-aquarium-and-shinsegae-mall-23.html))!
